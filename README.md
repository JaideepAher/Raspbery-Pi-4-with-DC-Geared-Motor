Introduction:

150RPM gear motor with position encoder is a high performance DC gear motor with optical position encoder. It gives 540 pulses per revolution of the output shaft. Motor can run smoothly from 4V to 12V. Position encoders are used in applications that requires precise angle of rotation of the motor such as robotics, automation etc.
